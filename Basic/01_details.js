 Why we should use JS 
 if we want to add dynamic funcnality in our application we have to use js 

 History of java script 
 In september 1995 Brendan Each a developer at net scape was developed a js programming in just 10 days
 - it was initially called Mocha then live Script.
 - In december 1995 the net scape and sun microsystems had a lisente agreement regarding Jscript hence it wad rename to jana script and specifically java script because java was the most popular at that time and this would help the marketing of js ass well.

 Java Scripts become Ecma script in 1997.
 ECMA stand for European computer manufacturing Association.
 
 Es6 they have to introduce in 2015.
 this is the turning point of js papular. 
 because it was introduce a many features like let-keyword, cons-keyword, Arrow function, map obj, set obj etc that y it was so popular

 the latest version of js is ES23.

  What is Java Script.
  Java script is oriented based and functional programming language
  which is
   Dynamic in nature.
   Synchronies prog language.
   Single threat.
   interpreted.
   weakly and lousily typed prog language.


   1. Dynamic in nature .
      it means that the variable are not bonded specific data type . you can assign different type of data type in different ur code.
        */
      
      let a = 100;
      a="hii"
      console.log(a);
      
/*
2.Synchronies prog language.
it means sequence wise they going to execute the code.
which means line by line.
Each code thy have to wait the previous code to get executed, the only the next code will get executed .
*/      
console.log("one ")
console.log("two ")

/*    3. Single threat.
it means that it can perform only one task at a time.
because in js we have only call stack. 

4.interpreted.

it is checked the code line by line.
which means top to bottom and left to right to left.

5. weakly and loosely typed prog lang .
it means the semicolon is not mandatory some places.
and some places semicolon semicolon is mandatory.
*/    
console.log("hello mr saffu")
//   if we want to write the output method in single line  we have to use semicolon.
console.log("hello mr saffu"); console.log("hello mr saffu")
